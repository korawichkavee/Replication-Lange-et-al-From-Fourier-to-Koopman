An attempt to reproduce and study the Fourier and Koopman model proposed by Lange et al 2021

# About
This is part of our group project for 10-701: Introduction to Machine Learning (PhD) (Spring 2024) titled "Physics Informed Machine Learning: A review and short replication". For empirical analysis, we have selected "From Fourier to Koopman: Spectral Methods for Long-term Time Series Prediction" by Henning Lange, Steven L. Brunton, Nathan Kutz.
